# Predictive-Analysis-on-Titanic-Data-Set
Project Description: Firstly I collected the data from  Kaggle and start exploring it then it discovered that there is a lot of missing and outlier data. so I 
               removed the outliers and resolve the missing data. After cleaning it I start Analyzing it and find many relations between two or more features like relation between the survived people and the Pclass feature. then I convert the 'Sex' and 'Embarked' Categorical features into Numerical data. then lastly I Train the model using Logical Regression. 
Project Result: accuracy_score(y_test, predictions) = 0.7611940298507462
